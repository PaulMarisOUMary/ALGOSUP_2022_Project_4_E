  "description": "A high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains components that you can use for locomotion and drawing visuals.",

    "changelog": "### Changed,- Changed the `XRI Default Input Actions` asset in the Starter Assets sample by removing the `primaryButton` bindings from Teleport Select and Teleport Mode Activate. If you want to restore the old behavior of both bindings, add an Up\\Down\\Left\\Right Composite, reassign the Up composite part binding, and add the Sector interaction for that direction. The actions were also reorganized into additional Action Maps.,### Fixed,- Fixed regression introduced with version [2.0.0](#200---2022-02-16) so the hover mesh draws in the correct location when the Interactable's Attach Transform is not a child Transform or deep child Transform.,- Fixed the `XRI Default Input Actions` asset in the Starter Assets sample showing the warning \"(Incompatible Value Type)\" on the bindings for Teleport Select and Teleport Mode Activate by changing the action type from Button to Value with an expected control type of `Vector2`. The sample needs to be imported again if you already imported it into your project for you to see these changes.,- Fixed missing `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` constraint in test assembly definition."
