# Project 4: Virtual Reality - Group F

Functionnal Specification **February 2022**
Team: *Paul MARIS, Clément CATON, Laurent BOUQUIN, Florent HUREAUX, Léo CHARTIER, Pierre GORIN*

# Overview

Our project is based on the Virtual Reality, we have to use it to simulate a typical day in Algosup when it will be based at B3.
One of our goal is to furnish the building and simulate somethings like the electrical outlets, restrooms, elevator and many other things that we have to imagine.

## 2. Project target

## 3. Project and scope

We need to have realistic and testable scenarios about access control, room usage, circulation, signage, furniture, storage, plugs, toilets, etc.
The virtual setup needs to be as close as possible to the real setup.
We need to obey the laws of physics in the virtual world, no super powers, you can’t walk across walls, fly, etc.

## 4. Ressource

At out disposal, we are provided with a 3d file produced by the architect of the building (bimx format) as well as 2D maps of each floor (PDF).
